# Network-Project-Traceroute_using_tcpdump

In, order to run program use below syntax:

$ ./http_downloader  http://www.xyz.com/sample.jpg  5

executable_file link_of_file_to_download number_of_connections

The http server should support range function.
Multiple connections will open to download same file and will combine them. (only verified for images and text file).

Thanks!!
